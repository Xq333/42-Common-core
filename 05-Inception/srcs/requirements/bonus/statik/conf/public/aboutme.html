          <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>Hello! I'm <em>Pedro</em>, a 20-year-old student at <em>42 School in France</em>, where I'm immersed in the fascinating world of coding. My journey in technology is filled with learning and challenges as I explore the realms of HTML, CSS, and ethical hacking. I'm passionate about problem-solving and creating efficient, elegant solutions through code.</p>
              <p>Outside of my academic pursuits, I maintain a balanced lifestyle with regular visits to the <em>gym</em>, focusing on overall fitness and well-being. This discipline in physical activity complements my dedication to my studies, helping me stay focused and energetic.</p>
              <p>I am enthusiastic about continuous learning and applying my skills in real-world scenarios. As I progress through my coding journey, I am excited to see where this path will take me, both in technology and in personal development. Welcome to my world of coding and growth!</p>
